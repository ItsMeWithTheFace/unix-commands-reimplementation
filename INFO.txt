Project Notes
ext2_cp
    The way we implemented this function was that you can take in 
    an image file, a local path to a source file and a path on the image to cp to.
    The path on the image can be a directory, resulting in a new file with the
    same name as the source file. The path could also be a path to a non-existent
    file, resulting in a file being created in that directory under that specified name.

    Some examples:
    ./ext2_cp onefile.img test.txt /testing

    This will copy the contents from test.txt into a new file called testing, since
    testing does not exist.

    ./ext2_cp twolevel.img test.txt /level1/

    This will copy the contents from test.txt into a new file called test.txt, since
    level1 exists and is a directory.

    ./ext2_cp twolevel.img test.txt /level1/level2/testing

    This copies the contents from test.txt into a new file called testing inside
    level2, since that does not exist yet. Note that /level1/level2/ must be a valid
    path for this to work.

ext2_ln
    Similar to ext2_cp, the user can specify a path to a directory or a new file as the
    third parameter and it will use the same naming schemes as in ext2_cp.
